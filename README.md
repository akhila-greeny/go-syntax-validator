# Go Syntax Validator

This project is a **syntax validator** for the **Go programming language**, implemented using **Python**.
It uses lexical analysis (lexer) and parsing (parser) techniques to check whether a given Go source code follows valid syntax rules

## Technologies Used

  - Python 3
  - Concepts of:
      - Lexical Analysis
      - Parsing
      - Compiler Design

## File Description

- **lexer.py**:
  Responsible for breaking the input Go source code into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.

- **parser.py**:
  Uses the tokens generated by the lexer to validate the syntax according to Go language grammar rules

## How It Works

- The lexer reads the input source code and converts it into a sequence of tokens.
- The parser analyzes these tokens to verify whether they follow valid Go syntax.
- If the syntax is correct, the program reports success.
- If an error is found, it reports a syntax error with relevant details.

## How To Run
python parser.py
